Clicking on a nest adds an ant to the queue if there is enough food in the nest
indicate the amount of food in the nest somehow
right click on the nest to make it auto-spawn whenever there is enough food

Clicking anywhere else spawns food

ants wander randomly until they detect food
what is their food/pheromone detection radius?
ants can carry 1/5 of a new-ant worth of food (1 pixel?)
store food in the green channel of color (don't merge with background)

two pheromones: searching for food and reporting food
they fade over time (same rate??)
Ants with food turn towards searching for food pheromone
ants without food turn towards reporting food pheromones
there is still a little wiggle to their walk so they optimize the path

later todos: obstacles for them to go around? more ant nests to fight? starvation?
